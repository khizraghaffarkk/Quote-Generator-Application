I have developed a small project using quotable API with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will provide the user with random new quote and its author name, everytime when he clicks on the "New Quote" button. Besides, user can also share this quote on twitter by clicking on the tweet button. I have deployed this with the help of Surge which is a static web publishing tool that allows us to quickly and easily deploy static websites to the web.
