I have developed a small project using quotable API with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will provide the user with a random new quote and its author name, whenever he clicks on the "New Quote" button. Besides, users can also share this quote on Twitter by clicking on the tweet button. I have deployed this with the help of Surge which is a static web publishing tool that allows us to quickly and easily deploy static websites to the web.
